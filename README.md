Overview

As part of my Masters in Business Analytics program, I was tasked with designing a text-based adventure game. To make it exciting, I decided to incorporate elements from "The Avengers" franchise, creating an engaging and interactive experience for players.

Conditions for the Executable Script:

1. Independence of Stages: The game features at least three stages, each independent of the others.
2. No Global Variables: The use of global variables is prohibited to maintain stage independence.
3. No Object-Oriented Programming: The game must rely solely on user-defined functions without utilizing class structures or other object-oriented programming constructs.
4. No Argument Passing Between Stages: Stages cannot inherit arguments from previous stages, ensuring complete independence (e.g., a key found in Stage 1 cannot be used in Stage 2).
5. Concise Introduction: The game includes a description of no more than 300 words introducing the story, game, and its objective.
6. Core Python Essentials: The game must utilize these fundamental Python elements - strings and string manipulation, user-defined functions and objects (variables), user input and input handling, conditional and nested conditional statements (if/elif/else), loops (for/while), and error handling (try/except).
